text example

We found latitudinal gradients, in both taxon and guild-based communities. The pattern could be driven by a environmental gradient (traits of plant), or space/distance; each correspond to a distinct ecological process.

We expect the relative importance of process vary with scale, taxon- and guild-based communities could also have different results (find reference).
